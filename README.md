# Calculator-made using Functions
Simple calculator that is made using funtions. It is made as a demonstration of functions, input, output, variables, operators, conditionals, loops... Calculator contains basic operations(+,-,*,/) and main menu. I wrote it to entertain my thirteen-year-old neighbor who is interested in programming.
